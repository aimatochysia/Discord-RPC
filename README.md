# Discord-RPC
Discord Custom Rich Presence that cycles through active apps and dynamically change the apps being displayed (including gif images and status)
To use this code for your Discord program, simply run the code and when asked, input your Discord App Client ID (can be accessed here:https://discord.com/developers/applications) then go to OAuth2 then Client ID. If you don't have a Discord App, then create one first then leave it as is and then copy the Client ID to the code by the same way.
If you decided to save the Client ID it will be saved locally on the directory of your code being run at.
