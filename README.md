# Discord-RPC
Discord Custom Rich Presence that cycles through active apps and dynamically change the apps being displayed (including gif images and status)
To use this code for your Discord program, simply change the "YOUR_DISCORD_APP_CLIENT_ID" part of the code to your Discord App Client ID (can be accessed here:https://discord.com/developers/applications). If you don't have a Discord App, then create one first then leave it as is and then copy the Client ID to the code.
